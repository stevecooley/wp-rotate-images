# wp-rotate-images
a stupidly simple plugin to add a shortcode to insert a button that will rotate all images 90 degrees. You please fork and complicate to your exact needs.

This plugin lets you add the shortcode of [rotate-images] to add a button and enqueue the related javascript file. There are currently no configuration options.
